Building a BN generative model based on HDI's Simulacrum synthetic cancer patient dataset

Data for this project uses artificial data from the Simulacrum, a synthetic dataset developed by Health Data Insight CiC derived from anonymous cancer data provided by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, which is part of Public Health England.

This project is based on Simulacrum data release, version 1.1.0, 2018-11-26\
For Simulacrum documentation and licensing details, please see https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/

Two of the data table .csv files are too large to upload to GitHub, but you can download them for yourself at https://simulacrum.healthdatainsight.org.uk/requesting-data/
